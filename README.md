## Description
Employee-Arranger is an application that allows you to keep track of all of your employees based on their departments and roles. You can add their personal information such as first name, last name, title, salary, and link their manager to their contact. This is a convenient application that alows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in a database. This type of interface is called content management systems (CMS). You'll be able to view your departments, roles, and employees. You'll also be able to add a department, role and employee, as well as edit employee information.
